        Put simply, TTAT works with local Kenya based teachers to go to
        schools (primary or secondary schools) to install computers for
        both teachers and students to use, all of which work with a
        Digital Library also provided by TTAT.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="para2 text-black">
        Labs are installed for no charge to the schools we work with, in
        return we ask that the school provides a room with running
        electricity and desks where we can install the computers and
        servers in, commit to sending a number of their teachers to
        locally run training, and agree to hold community based activities
        in their lab when asked.

        Each school, whether a primary or secondary school, gets 4
        computer stations installed in their staff rooms to ensure that
        teachers have access to the digital library at all times, so they
        can plan for their lessons with ease. We know that for teachers to
        use the digital library software in their lessons, they need to be
        able to explore what it has to offer, so we've made access as easy
        as possible.

      <p class="para4 fw-bold">
        We typically concentrate all our installations in January and work
        with a local Kenyan team to complete our installations. Since our
        initial installation at MP Shah Chania High School, we hear about
        schools through word of mouth and our local Kenyan team.
        Interested teachers can attend a training on how to best utilise
        the DIgital Library and how to integrate the material into their
        lessons by fellow teachers who work closely with TTAT.
