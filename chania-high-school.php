        <p class="fw-bold fs-6  ">The excitement of seeing students browse through the computer for knowledge was
          palpable
          at the Chania Boys'
          High School e-learning centre on Thursday afternoon. Their joy could be felt from afar as they received
          computers and digital material worth KEs. 1.5 million that had been donated by The Thika Alumni Trust (TTAT),
          ex-students of M P Shah Central High School (now Chania Boys’ and Girls’ High schools). </p>
        <p class="fw-bold fs-6 ">Harpal Punia said that he plus other alumni of the school living in the United
          Kingdom
          (UK), joined hands to
          form TTAT, a charitable organisation aimed at giving back to their former schools. </p>

          donated to
          the
          school by The Thika Alumni Trust (TTAT) to the Principal Peter Kariuki (in dark suit), Kiambu County C.E.C for
          Education Ms. Esther Ndirangu, parents, BOM members and students of Chania Boys High School. </p>

      <div class="img-info px-2">
        <p class="fw-bold fs-6 ">“As ex-students of Chania (Boys & Girls) High School in the UK, we came together and
          raised money to assist the school improve its infrastructure and enable the students get better education.
          When we talked to the principal, he informed us that one of his key priority was to have a school e-learning
          centre. We developed some really modern technology called RACHEL for the centre,” said Punia, one of the
          brains behind the whole exercise. </p>
        <p class="fw-bold fs-6 ">RACHEL or Remote Area Community Hotspot for Education and Learning is one of the
          most
          innovative technology solution for delivering free educational resources to developing communities, a
          prototype of a free offline digital library, a collection of leading educational resources, rebuilt as
          software that can be installed on any computer. </p>
        <p class="fw-bold fs-6 ">It is a collection of leading educational websites, rebuilt offline, for use in
          communities without internet. RACHEL content contains an encyclopedia (Wikipedia), video lectures (Khan
          Academy), textbooks (CK-12), educational games, coding programs, medical resources, and much more. </p>
        <p class="fw-bold fs-6 ">TTAT has also delivered free Wi-Fi that makes it possible for the teachers and
          students to
          access the internet and assist them in their studies. </p>
        <p class="fw-bold fs-6 ">“We have delivered wide range Wi-Fi connection that is available to teachers prepare
          their
          lessons before they come to class and run through it,” Punia explained. </p>
        <p class="fw-bold fs-6 ">Chania Boys High School is actually the first school in the country to enjoy this
          world-class technology. </p>
        <p class="fw-bold fs-6 ">Kiambu County C.E.C for Education ICT, Culture and Social Services Ms. Esther
          Ndirangu was
          a guest at the function was so impressed with the comprehensive learning content in the new system and the
          simplicity of its content delivery to the learners. </p>
        <p class="fw-bold fs-6 ">“What has impressed me most is that these computers are very well equipped with all
          the
          educational materials needed by the learners. The programming is very user friendly, there are a lot of
          explanations in there and ample revision exercises to do after every concept learnt,” said the CEC. </p>
        <p class="fw-bold fs-6 ">She acknowledged that this initiative would boost teaching and learning in the
          school
          as
          it assisted learners to learn at their own pace and at their own leisure. </p>
        <p class="fw-bold fs-6 ">She appealed to alumni from other schools to emulate this gesture and work out
          similar
          initiatives for their former schools so that we could improve the education standards of Kiambu County and
          guarantee a great future for the children. </p>

        <p class="fw-bold fs-6 ">“We are so grateful to these group of alumni who have been assisting us through various
          programmes. They started by donating KES. 100,000 worth of books for our library and later supplied furniture
          worth KES. 64,000 for our Dining Hall. They have today supplied 30 computers and e-learning material worth
          KES. 1.5 million,” said Mr. Kariuki. </p>
        <p class="fw-bold fs-6 ">He explained that this latest project would assist in occupying the boys and
          incorporating them into the global village. He acknowledged that the school was now at per with other world
          topnotch schools in terms of accessibility of learning content, a factor that will go a long way in improving
          the students' grades and their adaptability to the global environment. </p>
        <p class="fw-bold fs-6 ">“Our teachers now have a resource centre for use in lesson preparation. It will also
          ease the burden of teaching and learning. I believe that in a few years' time, Chania Boys High School will be
          among the leading learning centres in the country,” acknowledged the principal. </p>
