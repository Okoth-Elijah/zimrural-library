      </div>

      <div class="school-information mt-4 px-2">
        <p class="text-black fs-5  ">Karuri High School is one of the biggest beneficiaries of The Thika Alumni Trust.
          The
          trust initially visited the school in 20xx after the invitation by the then principal Mr. Patrick Mathu. </p>

        <p class="text-black fs-5 ">In 2020, the trust established a 50-desk Raspberry Pi e-learning Centre which was
          named
          after the chairman Harpal Punia. The e-learning Centre is served by two Internet-In-A- Box (IIAB) servers and
          two routers that allow the devices connect wirelessly. The server contains a collection of learning materials
          which each learner can access independently without requiring internet. </p>

        <P class="text-black fs-5">The 4-desk Teacher's Orientation system consists of 4-desk Raspberry Pi desktops in
          the
          staffroom served wirelessly by one server. These devices allow teachers to prepare for their lessons with
          ease. The teachers have been trained well on how to utilize the IIAB in their teaching and learning. </P>

        <P class="text-black fs-5">In 2022, TTAT established a second e-learning Centre consisting of 39 all-in-one
          desktops, two servers and two routers that allow wireless connection. This was after realizing that the first
          e-learning Centre was always over-booked due to the high population of students. These two centres have been
          instrumental in enabling integration of ICT in teaching and learning making education more inclusive. </P>

        <P class="text-black fs-5">Apart from the learning centres, TTAT has donated five projectors, laptops, two
          television sets among other assortment of electronic devices. KHS is now the base for TTAT in Kenya. </P>
