            Between 2012 and 2014, the Kenyan Government rolled out a
            program where every primary school was issued with a set of
            tablets, one tablet per child. To take advantage of what these
            tablets have to offer, TTAT installs
            <span class="text-black"> 3 Servers</span> which house our
            Digital Library learning materials, the contents of which can
            be found below, and
            <span class="text-black">3 Routers.</span> 2 of the Servers
            and Routers are for students to connect to with their tablets.
            The other Server and Router are installed in the staff room
            for teachers to use with their own personal devices or with
            the <span class="text-black"> 4 computer stations</span> that
            we also install, using the set up described below.

            All the equipment above is thoughtfully sourced to ensure that
            these eLearning Centers are not a huge drain for schools in

            is vital for schools as most schools run their eLearning
            centres for 8 to 12 hours on average.

          in our journey we experimented with using refurbished equipment,

          landed on this current setup which we used in our 2023 & 2024
          installations. For our 2025 installations, we are looking to
